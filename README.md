# ImmunoGuard - Vaccination Tracking System

## 📌 Project Overview
ImmunoGuard is a **C++-based vaccination tracking system** that efficiently manages immunization records using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The system provides an **automated way** to schedule, track, and update vaccinations, ensuring timely immunization for users.

Built using **C++ in Visual Studio**, the project leverages **file handling** for data persistence and integrates advanced **DSA concepts** such as **Hash Maps, Unordered Maps, Sorting Algorithms, and Searching Techniques** to enhance performance and usability.
